# Funding-Made-Eazy
A decentralized crowd-funding solution powered by smart contract and implementing a referral program where users can register and buy a membership, which lasts for 30 days. When a user buys a membership, a portion of the funds they pay are transferred to the user's parent (if they have one), a portion are used to reward the community, and a portion are used to pay fees. Active users can only renew their membership within a certain period before it expires.
